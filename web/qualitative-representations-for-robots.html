<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<!-- A description of the symposium, identifying specific areas of interest, and general symposium format. -->

<p>As the the field of robotics matures, the construction of ever more intelligent robots becomes possible. For many of the challenging tasks we want robots to perform it is crucial that the robot can be provided with <em>knowledge</em>: knowledge of its capabilities, of its environment, and of how the former interacts with the latter. The fields of AI and robotics have many approaches to representation and reasoning. This symposium focusses on one approach which has been growing in popularity across these communities recent years: <strong>qualitative representations</strong>. Such representations abstract away from the quantitative representations that underlie many physically situated systems, providing more compact, structured representations which omit (unnecessary) detail. Qualitative representations exist for many aspects of space and time; action; uncertainty; and categorical knowledge (ontologies).</p>
<p>Qualitative representations have many advantages, including naturally encoding semantics for many systems, being accessible to humans, providing smaller state spaces for learning and reasoning, and also suitable for communication via natural language. These advantages have seen them being increasingly used in intelligent physically-grounded systems, from encoding spatial configurations of objects, to modelling human behaviour over time. This work is being done in many different places, and across different subfields of AI such as knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, uncertainty, learning, and perception. We strongly believe that the time is now right to bring these disparate groups together to share experiences and technical knowledge. We also wish to connect the new applied work being done with qualitative representations in robotics to the rich history of related ideas in AI.</p>
<p>There is a growing momentum behind establishing a strong link between AI and robotics. AAAI has previously supported two successful Spring Symposium on the topic (Designing Intelligent Robots: Reintegrating AI I and II) and has a similar workshop at AAAI '13 (Intelligent Robotics Systems). Our aim is to build on the legacy of these events which had a <em>general focus</em> to construct a <em>specialist</em> community around the use of qualitative representations in robotics. This is an explicit link, as a member of our organising committee (Hawes) is part of the team behind these other events. In addition to this, members of the organising committee have a great deal of experience running similar events at both AI and robotics events, and have the many connections to both communities necessary to support an event of this nature.</p>
<h2 id="symposium-format">Symposium Format</h2>
<p>The symposium will consist of a half day poster session; half a day of talks for submitted papers (extended abstracts and full papers); approximately one full day’s worth of invited talks describing long-term research efforts aimed at using qualitative representations in intelligent systems; and approximately half a day of panel and breakout discussions aimed at identifying, and mapping progress towards, the key open questions in this field with respect to both AI and robotics. We will ensure that our list of invitees mix both established experts in qualitative reasoning (including from a non-robotic perspective) and researchers at the cutting edge of applying these techniques. We will integrate novel presentation methods such as lightening talks to ensure high engagement throughout the symposium.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of interest</h2>
<p>Relevant papers would include any use of qualitative representations or reasoning on robotics problems, including qualitative representations of</p>
<ul>
<li>space</li>
<li>motion</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>uncertainty</li>
<li>action/behaviour</li>
<li>categorical or functional knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>We will welcome papers which use such representations embedded within robot systems which learn, plan (both for tasks and motion), reason, or communicate.</p>
<p>We will particularly encourage contributions that exploit the key features of qualitative representations to provide new functionality to robot systems, e.g. using compact qualitative forms to learn from experience over very long term periods or across large-scale space.</p>
