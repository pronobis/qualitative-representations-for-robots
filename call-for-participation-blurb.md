The fields of AI and robotics have many approaches to representation and reasoning. This symposium focusses on one approach which has been growing in popularity across these communities in recent years: qualitative representations. Such representations abstract away from the quantitative features that underlie many physically situated systems, providing compact, structured representations which omit (unnecessary) detail. Qualitative representations have many advantages, including naturally encoding semantics for many systems, being accessible to humans, providing smaller state spaces for learning, and also suitability for communication. These advantages have seen them being increasingly used in intelligent, physically-grounded systems. This work is being done across many different subfields of AI including knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, learning, and perception. We strongly believe that the time is now right to bring these disparate groups together to share experiences and technical knowledge. We also wish to connect recent robotics work on qualitative representations to the rich history of related ideas in AI.

This symposium will address topics related to the use of qualitative representations or reasoning on robotics problems (e.g learning, task/motion planning, communication), including qualitative representations of

 * space
 * motion
 * time
 * uncertainty
 * action/behaviour
 * categorical or functional knowledge

We particularly encourage contributions that exploit the key features of qualitative representations to provide new functionality to robot systems, e.g. using qualitative forms to learn from experience over long periods or across large-scale space.

The format of the symposium mix invited talks and presentations by authors of accepted papers. We will also include discussions and poster sessions if time permits. This event runs in parallel with the symposium on "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics". Due to the overlapping nature of these events, we will have joint sessions and coordinate our activities.

Submissions should be in AAAI format, no longer than 7 pages, where page 7 must contain only references. 

Submissions should be made via XXX (link to go here).
